# ProjectX
Under Construction!


ProjectX is an effort to gather data from original Xbox games.


Data collection will include xbe metadata, file lists of retail games, tools to unpack and rapack archives from games, and lists of unpacked files.


Ideally, a program will be created to create markdown files automatically from a xbe files.


A protocol will be put into place to search for any interesting (debug) material left behind in games. One such example is using `grep` to search for terms like `debug`, `demo`, `test`, `http:\\`, `funny swears`, `Dr. Phil`, etc.


More to Come!
